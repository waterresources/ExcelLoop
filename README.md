### ExcelLoop

#### Description
This program seeks to take multiple excel (.xlsx) files and copy the contents to a newly created 
file of the user's choice. 
Setting the max nuber of rows is important (already in code)

#### Requirements
All we are using here is the following packages:
openpyxl, os

#### Running instructions
1) The user needs to ensure that the location is updated to the correct path on their machine
2) A new excel (xlsx) workbook is saved while running the project, so their is no need to create one, however the user must ensure desired path
3) The file name of the raw workbooks stays exactly the same, except for the year changing. This script will not work if Excel names are all different
4) OS needs to be imported to open the newly created file after creation. This can easly be commented out if not wanted
